## The challenge
The challenge consists in working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build an accurate age calculator.

## My process
I've started building the structure with HTML and styling it with CSS, when I was satisfied with the looks of it, I've started coding the age calculator.
It really was a challenge, as a beginner I've had a lot of research to do and in the process of making it I can say I've learned a lot. There is still work to be done, as I'm not 100% satisfied with the code, also I'm not sure if the number of days are accurate because I couldn't find consistent age calculators on web, so there's a lot to work on.

## Built with:

 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript
